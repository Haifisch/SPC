SPC "Rules to follow"
=====================

## General
Each round that SPC runs test spins 5 cases, so the single case price is multiplied to account for this.

SPC will also keep track of the number of cases rolled for the whole case test session, along with it's theoretical profit and spent amounts. 

## Collected Case Statistics
- Major wins 
	Rounds that produce 2x or more of what was theoretically spent.
- Wins
	Rounds that produce more than was theoretically spent but reaching the 2x threshold.
- Losses
	Rounds that produce less than what was theoretically spent. 
- Win rate
	All wins are combined and the rate is calculated against the tracked losses.
- ROI
	The theoretical return on investment.
- Rating
	This is the SPC rating.

## SPC Rating semantics
	Starting from a score of 0. 
	If a major win occurs add 2.
	If a regular win occurs add 1.
	If a loss occurs subtract 1. 

## Using exported data
When the exported data is graphed, large spikes in profits usually are the big ticket items -- most of the time the major wins reflect the jumps in the graph pretty accurately.

Knowing this, you could get a good picture of the varability of a selected case. Presumably, you can guess the safety of a case.
